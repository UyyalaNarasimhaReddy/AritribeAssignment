In a nutshell, Air Tribe, a fictional company, has assigned a task to create a task manager application as an assignment. This task involves designing and implementing a web-based application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. The application should include features such as adding tasks, updating task status, removing tasks, and organizing tasks based on their status (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed). Additionally, the application should provide a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop functionality and a task details modal for viewing and editing task details. The task also requires utilizing technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the application, as well as implementing local storage to ensure task persistence.
